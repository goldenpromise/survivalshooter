Survival Shooter Game
===================================

In this game, the user acts as a character in the game and shoots at zombies to kill them.

Introduction
------------

The user will utilize the arrow keys of the keyboard in order to move the player. The user also uses the mouse in order to shoot at zombies. The objective of the game is to shoot at all zombies that attempt to attack the player and to try to avoid getting hurt. The player's death is inevitable, however, and once that occurs, a message saying "Game Over!" will be streamed across the screen. Moreoever, killing zombies gives the user points.
